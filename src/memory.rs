//! Reporting of Rust-heap allocations to V8.
//!
//! A `JsDataFrame`/`JsSeries` is a small wrapper around data owned by the Rust
//! heap. V8 only sees the wrapper, so on its own it has no reason to collect
//! one, the finalizer never runs, and a long-lived process that builds a frame
//! per request grows without bound.
//!
//! `napi_adjust_external_memory` is how we tell V8 about those bytes: we report
//! a size when the value crosses into JS and withdraw the same reported size from the finalizer.
//!
//! `estimated_size` is re-measured at finalize time only to record drift (how
//! much the value grew/shrank after it was reported) so the accounting error can
//! be inspected from JS.
